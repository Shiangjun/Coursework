Dronechecker aimed to analyze if a filght plan would go through the no-fly zone

Two key insights are addressed:

1. Memory allocation

  From first to final, the frequency of memory allocation decreases.

  A crazy assumption is, if a program could be manually stopped, usual input method could cause faults.
  
  So the first version, it took four variables to enable check-input together, which is much more space-efficient.
  
 2. Mathematical optimization
 
   Standard solution igores the problem that, if one no-fly zone is inside another,
   
   simply calculating the distance between start/end point and central of circle could cause faults.
    
   So here, I applied another method to deal with this issue.

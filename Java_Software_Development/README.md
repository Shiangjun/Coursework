Please note:

	1. In order to support Moodle submission, all folders only contained 
		necessary parts. (Which means if u are testing via IDE, 
		it would take some time to build before actually run)
		
	2. To ease your marking process, I have set up everything u need to find
		on commits. U could check them directly.
		
	3. All submitted files are directly downloaded from my GitLab.
